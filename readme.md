# 🌐 Layerwise — Lazarev Website Clone

**Layerwise** is a high-fidelity clone of the [Lazarev Design Agency](https://lazarev.agency/) website.  
Built to practice modern front-end development techniques with a strong focus on design, motion, and user interaction.


## Features

- ✅ **Fully Responsive Layout**  
- 🌀 **Opening & Scroll-triggered Animations** (powered by GSAP & Shery.js)  
- 🎯 **Inertia-based Smooth Scroll** with Locomotive Scroll  
- 🎥 **Interactive Video Sections** and dynamic visual transitions  
- 🖱️ **Hover Effects**, SVG morph animations, button reveals  
- 🧩 **Modular and Well-Organized Code** for easy customization  
- 🌈 **Modern Aesthetic UI** inspired by real agency websites

## What I Learned

- Integration of **GSAP** and **Locomotive Scroll** for seamless scroll and motion
- Use of **Shery.js** for SVG morph animations and UI polish
- Responsive layout design with media queries and fluid typography
- Structuring HTML/CSS for performance and modularity
- Enhancing user interaction with hover effects and scroll triggers

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mannatgupta146/layerwise.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**

   ```bash
   cd layerwise
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   You can simply double-click it, or...

4. **(Recommended)** Use Live Server in VS Code:

   * Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
   * Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**

> ✅ No build tools or server setup required — it's a pure HTML/CSS/JS project.
